# aws-sigv4-resigning-proxy

A [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) addon that strips and re-signs AWS SigV4 requests on the fly, using credentials vended by [elhaz](https://github.com/61418/elhaz).

Companion to the EngSec Labs post: [Re-signing AWS at the proxy layer for AI agents](https://engseclabs.com/blog/aws-sigv4-resigning-proxy/).

## Prerequisites

- [elhaz](https://github.com/61418/elhaz) installed and daemon running
- A named elhaz config for the role you want the agent to use
- Python 3.12

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Create the virtualenv
bash setup_venv.sh

# 2. Start the proxy (separate terminal)
ELHAZ_CONFIG_NAME=my-agent-role bash start_proxy.sh

# 3. Run the test
bash test_resign.sh
```

The test calls `aws sts get-caller-identity` through the proxy. The returned ARN should be the elhaz role, not whatever identity is in your shell environment.
